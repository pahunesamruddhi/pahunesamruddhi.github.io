A BRIDGE BETWEEN BORROWING AND SAVING

WANT A QUICK OVERVIEW BEFORE YOU DIVE IN?

SmartCoin was killing it.

For India’s underbanked, it was the financial lifeline they needed.

But here’s the twist:

SmartCoin wasn’t just a lending app.

It already had savings features—gold deposits, rewards, investments. On paper, it looked balanced:

borrow today, save tomorrow.

In reality? Nobody was saving. Some didn’t even know saving was an option.

The very people who needed savings the most couldn’t see it.

To them, saving felt impossible, almost irrelevant.

One user put it bluntly during an interview:

“अगर मेरे पास बचाने के लिए पैसा होता तो मैं आपसे कर्ज क्यों लेता?”

“If I had money to save, why would I take a loan from you? I don’t have money to save.”

Brutal. Honest. Logical.

And it revealed the core challenge:

How do you convince people who come to borrow (for survival) to also save (for the future)?

I approached this like a detective case. No assumptions, no ready-made personas—just clues hidden in the system, in the data, and in people’s stories.

Phase 1: Foundations

Read everything: history of money, lending systems, fintech ecosystems.

Audited the app end-to-end: onboarding, loans, repayment, savings.

Phase 2: Quantitative

Analyzed 1 lakh+ users.

Looked at demographics, credit scores, repayment behavior, page visits.

Phase 3: Qualitative

30 interviews per user segment.

Dug into motivations, financial habits, fears.

It felt like staring at a massive block of stone. Slowly, by chipping away, human shapes started to emerge.

FOUNDATIONAL UNDERSTANDING : PROCESS

I mapped the journey end-to-end: what it felt like to be a user stepping into SmartCoin.

forms, friction, first impressions.

instant disbursal, the core hook.

relief or dread, depending on income stability.

Savings (if discovered):

confusing graphs, intimidating jargon, little connection to lived realities.

The flows were functional. But they weren’t designed to inspire trust, confidence, or curiosity.

FOUNDATIONAL UNDERSTANDING : UI AUDIT

Screens became evidence.

entirely loan-focused.

buried, chart-heavy, unclear purpose.

dense FAQs that increased anxiety.

The interface didn’t just reflect the paradox. It amplified it.

UNDERSTANDING BORROWING

Borrowing wasn’t a single behavior. It was a spectrum — psychological, social, and economic.

borrowing to grab time-sensitive chances.

indulging in goods and experiences otherwise out of reach.

investing in something lasting — education, property, business tools.

smoothing volatile earnings, ensuring steady consumption.

restructuring existing debts.

buying dignity, convenience, or relief in daily life.

Borrowing was never just about money. It was about aspiration, survival, and self-worth.

SCULPTING A MOUNTAIN OF DATA

Here was the hardest part:

Who exactly were we designing for?

the idea of “the SmartCoin user” was meaningless.

It felt like standing before a giant, shapeless block of stone. The data was there, vast and overwhelming.

The task wasn’t just to measure it — it was to sculpt it. To slowly chip away at noise until the outlines of real people began to emerge.

HOW DO YOU NARROW DOWN FROM 2.5L?

We started with numbers: a

sample of 1 lakh users.

Who are they? Where do they live? What’s their credit profile? How do they move inside the app?

Three lenses brought order:

(age, location, employment)

(credit scores, loan eligibility)

(loan amounts, repayment behavior, most visited pages)

Patterns emerged. Clusters formed. The stone began to crack open.

GIVING THE SEGMENTS A VOICE

But numbers alone can’t explain human logic. Data only says

So we sat with users. We asked about choices, struggles, and the stories behind every loan.

This is where the paradox spoke loudest. Over and over, we heard:

“If I had money to save, why would I take a loan?”

Suddenly, the clusters weren’t just rows in a dataset. They had voices. Emotions. Frustrations.

WHO ARE WE DESIGNING FOR?

Through this layered process, three distinct archetypes emerged — the anchors for our design work:

The Eternal Borrower

Imagine someone living on the edge of their income. Rent, groceries, school fees — everything consumes more than they earn. The gap is permanent. SmartCoin is their safety net. Each time a loan comes through, it’s oxygen.

Survive the month. Keep afloat.

Always borrows the full loan amount. Repayment is the top priority, sometimes at the cost of other needs.

Saving feels insulting. It’s not just out of reach — it feels like advice from another planet.

The Goal-Oriented Borrower

Now, picture someone else. For them, borrowing is purposeful, not habitual. They borrow for milestones: medical bills, school fees, family events. They’re disciplined. They compare options. They already think about saving, but their current tools don’t align with their needs.

Achieve specific goals. Plan for stability.

Borrows only what is necessary. Looks for better products. Actively seeks financial knowledge

No clear bridge between short-term loans and long-term goals.

The Profit-Driven Investor

Finally, imagine a small business owner. To them, a loan isn’t debt — it’s leverage. Money borrowed today is capital to grow tomorrow. They’re sharp, opportunistic, and focused on ROI. For them, credit is a tool, not a burden.

Business expansion, profit.

Borrows maximum amounts. Often repays early to cut interest. Rarely saves in traditional ways — extra cash goes back into the business.

Credit ceilings. Slow disbursal times. They need more, faster.

WHY THESE STEPS MATTERED

The Eternal Borrower and The Profit-Driven Investor looked identical.

Both maxed out loans every time.

But motivations were worlds apart:

One barely surviving.

One building growth.

Without the qualitative work, we’d have collapsed them into one — and designed solutions for nobody.

With our three archetypes defined, the next step was to walk in their shoes — tracing how they actually moved through SmartCoin and beyond. We mapped each stage of their journey, from onboarding to repayment, to uncover where intentions collided with reality.

BEHAVIORAL STATEMENT

users driven by an immediate need for cash want to secure a loan as quickly and easily as possible

follow the single, transactional path focused exclusively on their loan status and remain completely unaware of the app's 'buried' wealth-building features like Gold Savings and Rewards,

app analytics showing low traffic on non-lending pages and qualitative interviews confirming a profound lack of awareness and the powerful mental block that saving is an unattainable luxury for borrowers

BORROWING OVERSHADOWS SAVING

With three archetypes defined, the next step was to

through SmartCoin. What we found was sobering.

No matter who we looked at — the Eternal Borrower surviving paycheck to paycheck, the Goal-Oriented Borrower chasing milestones, or the Profit-Driven Investor fueling growth — every journey collapsed into the same loop:

borrow → repay → exit

The app gave them money. They used it. They repaid. And they left.

The supposed second half of the story — saving, rewards, wealth-building — remained invisible. Not just undiscovered, but

psychologically impossible.

The deeper we looked, the clearer it became: this wasn’t a simple issue of “users don’t save.” It was a clash of

tensions baked into the product itself.

IMMEDIATE NEED vs. LONG-TERM GOAL

SmartCoin delivered instant loans flawlessly.

But it failed to surface the path to long-term stability.

SPEED vs. UNDERSTANDING

The app optimized for frictionless borrowing.

But financial concepts remained unexplained, leaving users rushed and unconfident.

BORROWING vs. SAVING

By treating these as separate, competing actions, the app reinforced a damaging belief: saving is only possible with surplus money.

The app solved today’s pain, but erased tomorrow’s possibility.

We needed a new principles — a way to resolve these tensions and rebuild the product around balance.

Every feature must connect today’s needs with tomorrow’s security. Saving and borrowing can’t live in silos — they must feed each other.

The path to financial wellness must be visible, obvious, and natural. No buried gardens.

Financial concepts must be demystified. Confidence grows only when clarity is present.

These weren’t abstract ideals. They became the

lens through which every idea, sketch, and design decision was tested.

Using these principles as anchors, we sketched interventions

SmartCoin’s redesign wasn’t about adding shiny new tools. It was about taking what already existed — hidden, intimidating, ignored — and making it

visible, simple, and human.

A SAVINGS PAGE REBUILT

was like a forgotten garden:

Buried deep in navigation.

Overloaded with charts and scores.

Designed for financial experts, not everyday borrowers.

Users described it as

MAKING THE SCORE UNDERSTANDABLE

We rebuilt it from the ground up.

Old score out of 10 → scrapped.

It was abstract, meaningless.

Save daily for 7 days → earn rewards.

A clear, tangible challenge. Simple enough for anyone, motivating enough to try.

The shift was subtle but powerful: from an intimidating “financial health score” to a

daily, achievable action.

CHILLAR: SAVE WHILE YOU BORROW

The paradox’s sharpest edge came from this user statement:

“If I had money to save, why would I take a loan?”

The belief was clear: saving required surplus. Borrowers had none.

Each repayment automatically triggered a tiny saving — “loose change.”

Saving no longer demanded a conscious decision. It became a side-effect of repayment.

What was once the end of the journey (repayment) became the

beginning of a new one.

Borrowing and saving were no longer opposites. They were tied together.

The barrier dropped from “I need extra” to “I can save without even trying.”

Chillar wasn’t just a feature. It was a mindset shift:

saving is possible even when you’re borrowing.

IMPROVING DISCOVERABILITY

If savings were to matter, they had to be impossible to miss.

Progressive Onboarding

No more overwhelming forms at the start. New users were introduced step by step. Features unfolded gradually, building confidence instead of confusion.

The homepage shifted from a single-purpose loan tracker into a

financial dashboard.

Credit Score, Rewards, and Gold Savings surfaced upfront.

Subtle “quick action” animations nudged users toward features without distracting them.

The homepage no longer screamed

“your financial toolkit.”

One discovery was almost tragic: users

didn’t know their rewards could be redeemed.

They were earning coins — and letting them rot.

Each time coins were earned, a message appeared:

“You’ve earned X coins. Convert them to gold now.”

Immediate awareness. Immediate action.

A small detail. A big shift in perception.

SmartCoin excelled at speed. But in the rush to deliver instant loans, it created

invisible friction —

confusion and intimidation.

On every major screen, a single, clear element highlighted

the most important action.

Users always knew what to do next. Cognitive load dropped.

SIMPLIFYING HELP : A CONVERSATION NOT A LIST

The old Help section was a wall of FAQs. For anxious users with urgent money questions, it was a nightmare.

We redesigned it into a

Calm clarity instead of information overload.

This turned a maze into a guided path. Users left reassured, not more anxious.

A progressive flow replaced overwhelming forms. Features revealed gradually, creating trust and curiosity.

No longer a loan-only tracker. Now a dashboard where credit scores, rewards, and savings stood upfront.

Rewards became tangible currency, usable for discounts on processing fees.

Chillar made saving feel automatic, tied to repayment, shattering the “I can’t save” belief.

A goal-oriented UI and conversational Help replaced jargon and overload with clarity.

SmartCoin didn’t just become easier. It became

friendlier, more human, and more hopeful.

This project was never just about redesigning an app. It was about

From a crore of messy records, we carved clear personas. Rigour brought clarity.

Behavior shows the “what.” Motivation reveals the “why.”

The best design isn’t more features. It’s making the right choice feel like the easy one.

SmartCoin taught me:

Design’s job is to build bridges.

From immediate need to long-term stability.

From borrowing to saving.

From survival to security.

A STORY ABOUT DOUBT, DISCOVERY AND AN INVISIBLE GUIDE

WANT A QUICK OVERVIEW BEFORE YOU DIVE IN?

THE HIDDEN GARDEN, UNSEEN

80% of first-time visitors to Van Vihar missed the butterfly garden — home to 2,500 butterflies of 50+ species.

The reason wasn’t disinterest. It was that the visitor journey simply failed to reveal it.

Our challenge was to understand

why discovery kept failing

— and how we might reimagine the journey so that wonder could surface naturally, without friction, stress, or chance.

CREDITS - film by Tushar Bhojwani on Van Vihar National Park and Zoo, Bhopal

Over the years, Van Vihar had grown into a sprawling park, but its visitor experience hadn’t kept pace.

was transactional: tariffs, timings, rules — no inspiration.

pushed people down a single road, with little signal as to what lay beyond the forks.

In practice, this meant discovery collapsed into a

: lions, tigers, crocodiles — then exit. Everything else, including the butterfly garden, was invisible.

The guiding question became:

How might we increase the proportion of first-time visitors who discover hidden attractions, without adding time, stress, or effort?

BALANCING GUIDANCE AND WONDER

Revealing wonder for everyone, without losing the magic

Three primary questions informed our design strategy:

How do you reduce doubt without over-directing exploration?

What contexts limit discovery for different visitors (caretakers vs. seekers)?

What does the “perfect visit” look like — emotionally, spatially, and temporally?

Early on, it was clear that designing for Van Vihar wasn’t about adding signs or features. It was about balancing two opposing forces: the Responsible Caretaker’s need for clarity, and the Experience Seeker’s desire for curiosity.

EARLY FIELD INSIGHTS

A ROAD THAT PUSHES YOU FORWARD

The main straight road acted like a default setting. Visitors rarely turned unless the attraction was visible from the road.

Early on, it was clear that designing for Van Vihar wasn’t about adding signs or features. It was about balancing two opposing forces: the Responsible Caretaker’s need for clarity, and the Experience Seeker’s desire for curiosity.

We traced the rhythms of the park not as designers, but as wanderers, trying to understand how a place like Van Vihar reveals itself to a stranger.

We created a blueprint mapping the entire visitor journey: from website and ticketing, to paths and attractions, to exit. This helped align frontstage (visitor experience) with backstage (systems, staff, processes). The blueprint revealed a central tension: the system was optimized for transactions (timings, tickets, rules), not experiences (discovery, stories, delight).

As we synthesized research, it became clear that the challenge wasn’t just “visitors miss attractions.” It was deeper: their experience sat on a tension between -

Too much clarity flattens the visit into a checklist.

Too much curiosity without anchors leaves people uncertain.

The balance lies in guiding just enough to let wonder unfold.

Nature invites freedom and immersion.

Service layers often impose bureaucracy and control.

The balance lies in systems that support without overshadowing.

Guidance that is too visible kills curiosity.

Guidance that is too invisible leaves discovery to chance.

The balance lies in subtle cues — felt more than seen.

THE DESIGN PRINCIPLES

From the three balances, we defined guiding principles for ideation. These became the lens through which every intervention was evaluated.

Clarity × Curiosity → Guide, Don’t Dictate

Design should reduce doubt without flattening discovery.

Visitors need just enough orientation to feel safe, and just enough openness to feel wonder.

Nature × Service → Support, Don’t Overshadow

Services should enable nature, not compete with it.

Ticketing, navigation, and systems must fade into the background so the park remains the hero.

Visible × Invisible → Subtle, Not Silent

Guidance should be felt more than seen.

Cues must be present enough to orient, quiet enough to preserve curiosity.

Using these principles as anchors, we sketched interventions across touchpoints — from the entry experience to wayfinding to storytelling. We explored ideas that could act as an ‘Invisible Guide’: subtle, systemic cues that restore balance without breaking immersion

We filtered ideas by testing them against our three design principles. Some didn’t make the cut:

Broke Guide, Don’t Dictate

→ too much clarity, no curiosity.

Broke Subtle, Not Silent

→ guidance became heavy-handed.

Broke Support, Don’t Overshadow

→ game overshadowed nature.

Broke Support, Don’t Overshadow

→ tech distracted from the environment.

Why it matters: Saying no was as important as saying yes. It kept the Invisible Guide true to balance — gentle, systemic, and in harmony with the park.

ready to take a walk through the park?

We begin at the entrance. No long queues, no fumbling for cash.

Instead, a bold but quiet prompt — a giant QR. We pause, curious, and scan.

In seconds, everything opens up: tickets, payments, and the park itself. The day starts not with rules, but with a question:

“What might we find in here?”

We head down the main path. But this time, the road doesn’t trap us.

On our phone, a living map unfurls. At a glance, the entire park. Zoom in, and trails, animals, and utilities appear. Zoom further, and enclosures breathe with icons and stories.

You look down — zebra stripes painted on the path. You look up — the same stripes mirrored on the map. Suddenly, a fork isn’t confusing. It’s an invitation. You don't want to look at your phone, no worries, let the path guide you!

We stop at the tiger enclosure. No dense text panels, no dry signage.

Instead, a tap on the map reveals a short, visual story: a tiger rescued from captivity, now thriving here.

At the bear enclosure, another story unfolds — survival, care, recovery.

The park stops being a checklist of species. It becomes a place of encounters.

By the end of the walk, we hardly notice the guide. The map, the stripes, the QR, the itineraries, the stories

— none shouted, none dictated.

But together, they restored balance:

clarity without control,

curiosity without confusion,

service without overshadowing nature.

And yet, this was only our walk-through.

The real question remained:

Would first-time visitors feel it too? Would they discover the butterfly garden, not by accident, but by design?

That question led us to our next step — concept testing.

Before bringing the Invisible Guide back to Van Vihar, we needed a safe, controllable space to test the concept. We piloted it on a university campus — reimagining hidden courtyards, gardens, and nooks as “attractions.” The goal was simple: would subtle cues actually change behaviour?

Students discovered new places they’d never visited.

Proof that removing friction unlocks curiosity — and curiosity unlocks wonder.

This project reinforced a principle I carry forward:

Great service design doesn’t add complexity; it aligns behavior with intent by removing friction.

As a researcher, my role wasn’t just surfacing pain points. It was turning them into

behavioral goals, measurable outcomes, and frameworks that guided design —

ensuring solutions reduced stress for caretakers while amplifying wonder for seekers.

The future of Van Vihar isn’t more technology — it’s deeper connection.

By making discovery effortless, we make space for wonder. By letting technology disappear, we let nature shine.
