## Project 1: ICICI Bank Voicebot

**Title**: VOICEBOT DESIGN PROJECT (ONGOING)

**Context**: Transactional, NLP-powered voicebot for ICICI Bank. High-stakes banking on call with 70+ live use cases (payments, card controls, security actions). Call: 1800 1080.

**Role**: Lead Designer - architecting flows for financial transactions, translating NLP capabilities + API constraints into seamless conversations, crafting microcopy, working with ML engineers, compliance teams, solution architects.

**Challenge**: 
- Complex financial rules requiring airtight compliance
- Human unpredictability (interruptions, mumbles, anger)
- Massive scale (70+ distinct flows, mission-critical)
- Tech limits (latency, noisy environments, accent diversity)
- "Designing trust in voice"

**Approach**:
- Flow architecture: clear entry/exit, mandatory confirmations, layered fallbacks
- Micro-copy building confidence: professional, empathetic, precise tone
- Collaboration: intent hierarchies, API mapping, data annotation guidance, voice alignment

**Outcome**:
- One of the first transactional voicebots in India
- 70+ live use cases, from everyday tasks to critical security controls
- Dramatic reduction in call center dependency

## Project 2: SmartCoin - A Bridge Between Borrowing and Saving

**Setup**: SmartCoin had 1.1 crore users, instant loans, minimal paperwork. Already had savings features (gold deposits, rewards, investments), but nobody was saving. Many didn't know saving was an option.

**The Paradox**: User quote - "If I had money to save, why would I take a loan from you? I don't have money to save."

**Research Method**:
- Phase 1: Read everything (history of money, lending systems), audited app end-to-end
- Phase 2: Analyzed 1 lakh+ users (demographics, credit scores, repayment behavior)
- Phase 3: 30 interviews per user segment (motivations, financial habits, fears)

**Three Personas**:
1. **The Eternal Borrower** - Living on edge of income, borrow to survive the month, saving feels insulting
2. **The Goal-Oriented Borrower** - Borrow for milestones, disciplined, already think about saving
3. **The Profit-Driven Investor** - Small business owner, loan = leverage, credit is a tool not burden

**Key Insight**: "Borrowing overshadows saving" - Every journey collapsed into: borrow → repay → exit. Saving remained invisible and "psychologically impossible."

**Three Balances**:
- Immediate Need vs. Long-Term Goal
- Speed vs. Understanding  
- Borrowing vs. Saving

**Design Principles**:
- Encouraging Saving: Connect today's needs with tomorrow's security
- Discoverability: Path to financial wellness must be visible, obvious, natural
- Simplification: Financial concepts must be demystified

**Solutions**:
- **Savings Page Rebuilt**: Old score out of 10 scrapped → New model: Save daily for 7 days = earn rewards
- **Chillar**: Auto-save "loose change" with each repayment - saving became side-effect of repayment
- **Progressive Onboarding**: Features unfold gradually, building confidence
- **New Homepage**: Dashboard with Credit Score, Rewards, Gold Savings upfront
- **Loop Closer**: Popup when coins earned: "Convert them to gold now"
- **Goal-Oriented UI**: Single clear action highlighted on each screen
- **Conversational Help**: Chat-like flow replacing FAQ wall

**Reflection**: "Design's job is to build bridges. From immediate need to long-term stability. From borrowing to saving. From survival to security."

## Project 3: VIHAR - Van Vihar National Park

**Title**: A STORY ABOUT DOUBT, DISCOVERY AND AN INVISIBLE GUIDE

**Problem**: 80% of first-time visitors missed the butterfly garden (2,500 butterflies, 50+ species). Reason: visitor journey failed to reveal it.

**Core Issue**: 
- Website was transactional (tariffs, timings, rules - no inspiration)
- Entry felt bureaucratic (cash-only queues, offline verification)
- Pathways pushed single road, discovery collapsed into checklist: lions, tigers, crocodiles, then exit

**Two Personas**:
- **The Responsible Caretaker**: Needs safety, clarity, predictability. Stays on main road, avoids unclear paths. Stress when uncertain.
- **The Experience Seeker**: Wants novelty, hidden gems, stories. Explores if curious but skips bureaucratic moments.

**Behavioral Statement**: "When first-time visitors with limited knowledge want to see highlights, they will stay on main road and only visit obvious attractions as measured by tracking, shadowing, and self-reported awareness of missed attractions"

**Three Balances**:
- **Clarity × Curiosity**: Too much clarity = checklist, too much curiosity = uncertainty
- **Nature × Service**: Service should enable nature, not compete with it
- **Visible × Invisible**: Guidance felt more than seen

**Design Principles**:
- Guide, Don't Dictate
- Support, Don't Overshadow  
- Subtle, Not Silent

**Solutions - "The Invisible Guide"**:
- **Giant QR at entrance**: Scan for instant tickets, payments, park access (no queues)
- **Living map**: Entire park view, zoom for trails/animals/utilities, enclosure stories on tap
- **Zebra stripes on paths**: Physical path markings mirrored on digital map
- **Visual stories at enclosures**: Short stories (tiger rescued from captivity) instead of dense text panels
- **Suggested itineraries**: Curated paths matched to visitor type

**Concept Testing**: Piloted on university campus with hidden courtyards as "attractions"
- 80% scanned QR instantly
- Students discovered new places never visited
- Described as "treasure hunt"

**Reflection**: "Great service design doesn't add complexity; it aligns behavior with intent by removing friction."

## Project 4: Bhopal By Bike - Chartered Cycles

**Title**: THE CURIOUS CASE OF BHOPAL'S UNRIDDEN CYCLES

**Problem**: Bhopal launched Chartered Cycles (500 GPS bikes, 100+ docking stations) in 2017. Five years later, <3% of 2.3M citizens had used them. Bikes sat still despite visibility.

**Root Causes**:
- **Misaligned model**: Revenue from ads on stations, rental experience neglected
- **Broken communication**: Signage cluttered with ads, buried instructions
- **Perception of abandonment**: Visible everywhere but rarely used = seemed failed

**Research**: 78 surveys, 11 dock safaris, stakeholder interviews, app/social media audits, comparative analysis (Yulu, Mobike, Amsterdam)

**The Disconnect - Authority vs. User Statements**:
- Maintenance: "Twice daily" vs "Tyres punctured, lock problems"
- Usability: "Users figure it out" vs "Don't know how to use them"
- Features: "Can't give all comforts" vs "Extremely difficult to manage phone"

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Chain 1: Business Model → Neglected UX
- Chain 2: Authorities' Attitude → Semantic Weakness
- Chain 3: Declining Engagement → Negative Perception

**Behavioral Statement**: "When first-time users curious about service want a convenient ride, they will abandon after encountering confusing, ad-cluttered, unreadable instructions at docking station"

**Design Principles**:
- Automation vs. Assurance → Add a Human Touch
- Visibility vs. Understanding → Communicate, not Exist
- Commerce vs. Service → Service that serves both

**Solutions - "Phygital"**:
- **Shop at the dock**: Amul kiosk beside dock - shopkeeper as friendly human guide
- **Redesigned posters**: Clear instructions, relatable language, showcase affordability
- **Pop-up info board**: Large QR code for one-minute explainer video
- **Info strip on cycle back**: More graphical, less text-heavy
- **Posters on cycle**: "₹20 for an hour" - moving billboards

**Concept Testing**: Campus suggestion box pilot near Amul kiosk
- 45 people approached
- 27 (60%) scanned QR to understand
- 13 (48% conversion) actually used suggestion box
- Proved barrier was lack of understanding, not apathy

**Reflection**: "The biggest problems aren't about technology or price, but about a fundamental failure in communication."

## Project 5: DOTTIE - IndiGo Voice Assistant

**Title**: WHAT IF YOU COULD CALL AND BOOK A FLIGHT?

**Note**: Speculative design exercise (not official IndiGo project)

**Concept**: Voice assistant for IndiGo - "Book me a flight from Delhi to Goa tomorrow morning." No menus, no typing, no waiting.

**IndiGo Brand**:
- India's leading low-cost carrier
- Reputation: on-time, professional, reliable
- Brand voice: approachable, fun, modern (wordplay, "6E = sexy", slang, emojis)

**Two Personas**:
- **The Frequent Flyer**: Monthly work travel, needs efficiency, zero friction
- **The Savvy Saver**: Leisure every few months, wants cheapest fares, maximize savings

**Scope**:
- Can: Book tickets, manage bookings (reschedule/cancel/check-in/add baggage), answer FAQs, escalate to human
- Cannot: Compare with other airlines, handle unusual requests, replace human empathy

**Payment Strategy**: Not on-call - secure link via SMS/WhatsApp, complete outside call, Dottie resumes after confirmation

**Dottie's Personality**: Modern, approachable, fun
- "Ding! You're set for Goa. Get packing"
- "Early morning flights? You must be a morning person."
- "I know this isn't ideal, but let's fix it together."

**Flight Suggestion Logic**: Presents 3 options with trade-offs
- Cheapest (lowest fare)
- Fastest (shortest duration)
- Best Balance (good timing + reasonable fare)

**Reflection**: Practice translating brand identity into conversational design, defining intents/entities/flows, imagining ML training systems, designing error handling and escalation.

## What needs to change in positioning

Current framing:
- "Lead Designer" / "Conversational Designer"
- Language focused on UX process: "architecting flows," "crafting microcopy," "designing for panic"
- Projects feel like design execution rather than systems ownership
- Mix of UX research projects (Van Vihar, Bhopal Bikes, SmartCoin) with AI systems work (ICICI)

Target framing:
- AI Systems & Automation Behavior Owner
- Language shift: "defined decision logic," "built escalation policy," "owned confidence thresholds"
- Foreground: decision boundaries, fallback logic, risk-aware automation
- The positioning statement "I build automation that knows when to stop" should be evident in work presentation
- Prioritize: ICICI Bank work (real transactional AI), SmartCoin's "Chillar" feature (automation design)
- De-prioritize or reframe: Speculative projects (Dottie), pure UX research (Van Vihar, Bhopal Bikes) unless they demonstrate systems thinking
